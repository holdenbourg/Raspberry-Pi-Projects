# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In these projects, we solved different problems overall, but one we solved that was alike was familiarizing ourselves with the hardware/software so we could better understand projects ahead. In the Client/Server project, we implemented code that would allow us to communicate with our Pi via a Client/Server relationship. This helps us understand certain relationships that these embedded systems can use to communicate. In the Morse Code Project, we had the Pi's blinking LEDs switch (on button press) between showing SOS and OK in Morse Code. This helped us understand states better in that when we clicked the button mid-message, it didn't crash, but instead handled it gracefully.
# What did you do particularly well?
Software has always been my strength as opposed to hardware. In these projects, I'd say I handled the software quite well in that I really didn't have any issues getting projects implemented; instead, it was teh hardware giving me a hard time.
# Where could you improve?
Hardware is definitely where I am weakest, so following instructions to get things built is where I need to practice.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
A slight understanding of Embedded Systems and how they may communicate is a tool I'm glad to say I have now. As far as resources go, StackOverflow was a huge help for the problems I faced throughout the course
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Coding in Python is a skill that will definitely help me in future courses and one I'm proud to have learned in this course, as it is a language I've been meaning to get started with for a while.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Implementing good coding practices and commenting around functions to help a first-time reader understand what they're reading should definitely help to make these projects easier to understand.
